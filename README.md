### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   cd my-app
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install axios bootstrap cors firebase
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables for the frontend:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
   // ...other variables
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   This command will serve the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Start the backend server:**
   In a separate terminal, navigate to your backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/backend
   node server.js
   ```
   Your backend will now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.
